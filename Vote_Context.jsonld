    "comment": "As a DRep, my role is to represent the community’s long-term interests, ensuring Cardano's sustainability, security, and decentralization. After carefully evaluating this proposal, I support reducing the treasury cut from 20% to 10% for the following reasons:\n\n1. Economic Sustainability & Incentive Alignment:\nThe proposal provides compelling evidence that the current 20% treasury cut was an arbitrary initial choice at the launch of Shelley. Reducing it to 10% enhances staking incentives, potentially increasing decentralization, network participation, and security without compromising the treasury’s long-term sustainability.\n\n2.Clear Mathematical and Economic Justification:\nThe proposal offers explicit and transparent economic modeling. The demonstrated improvement from ~4.0–4.5% APY represents a meaningful increase in staking rewards, aligning with the goal to attract more participants and secure the network robustly.\n\n3.Alignment with Cardano’s Constitution and Governance Framework:\nThis proposal complies fully with the constitutional provisions (explicitly allowed treasury cuts between 10%–30%), indicating thoughtful adherence to established governance standards.\n\n4.Strategic Benefit for the Ecosystem:\nEncouraging greater direct staking participation, rather than dependency on treasury allocations, strengthens organic ecosystem development. This aligns Cardano’s incentives towards sustainable growth and competitive positioning."
