I am motivated to become a DRep because I believe that overcoming these challenges is what will make Cardano truly resilient. Balancing diverse opinions, ensuring transparency, and making informed decisions are not easy tasks, but they are crucial—and I am ready to take them on.\n\nSince joining Cardano in 2021, I have actively contributed as a Project Catalyst Community Reviewer and Milestone Reviewer, evaluating proposals with fairness and accountability. This experience exposed me to the real challenges of decentralized decision-making and strengthened my commitment to improving the process.\n\nI aim to bring technical expertise from my work in Plutus, Aiken smart contracts, and stake pool operations, alongside my experience in community building, particularly in Southeast Asia. My focus is on promoting transparency, encouraging innovation, and ensuring that all voices are heard.",
